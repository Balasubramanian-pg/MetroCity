The idea of creating metadata and using a lookup function within a fabric pipeline is aimed at making the process of managing and mapping data more flexible and automated. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the concept:

Metadata Creation: Metadata is created to describe the attributes and structure of the data. This includes details like data types, relationships, and how data from different sources map to each other.

Lookup Function: A lookup function within the pipeline uses this metadata to dynamically retrieve and apply the correct data mappings and transformations. Think of it as a reference tool that looks up the necessary instructions from the metadata to handle the data correctly.

Parameterization: The creation and mapping of data are parameterized, meaning they are controlled by parameters defined in the metadata. This allows for flexibility, as changes to the data sources or structures can be managed by updating the metadata rather than modifying the pipeline code itself.

Reducing Manual Intervention: By using metadata and a lookup function, the need for manual changes to the pipeline is minimized. When a new data source is added or an existing one changes, you update the metadata, and the pipeline automatically adjusts based on the new metadata. This reduces errors and saves time compared to manually updating the pipeline code.

In essence, this approach streamlines data management by making the pipeline more adaptable and reducing the dependency on manual updates. This leads to a more efficient, scalable, and maintainable data processing system.
